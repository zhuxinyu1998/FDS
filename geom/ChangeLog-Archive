* Fri Feb 26 2016 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.23.1-20160601
- The geom module has been completely overhauled.  Types are now specified
  as GEOMETRY(POINT) instead of POINT, old functions have been removed,
  new ones introduced.  However, even with all the changes, a database
  upgrade should still be possible (as always, make a backup first).

* Fri Jul 29 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.5.1-20110907
- Implemented NULL checks in the geom module.  Now when given NULL
  as input, the module functions return NULL instead of an exception.
  This fixes bug 2814.

* Wed Apr 27 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.3.3-20110517
- Fixed various problems so that now all our tests work correctly on
  all our testing platforms.

* Tue Mar 15 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.1.1-20110317
- Set endianness for wkb en/decoding.

* Mon May 31 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 0.18.1-20100618
- Updated Vendor information.

* Tue Apr 20 2010 Stefan Manegold <manegold@cwi.nl> - 0.18.1-20100618
- Made compilation of "testing" (and "java") independent of MonetDB.
  This is mainly for Windows, but also on other systems, "testing" can
  now be built independently of (and hence before) "MonetDB".  Files
  that mimic configure functionality on Windows were moved from
  "MonetDB" to "buildtools"; hence, this affects all packages on
  Windows, requiring a complete rebuild from scratch on Windows.
  getopt() support in testing has changed; hence, (most probably)
  requiring a rebuild from scratch of testing on other systems.

* Tue Apr 20 2010 Stefan Manegold <manegold@cwi.nl> - 0.18.1-20100618
- Implemented build directory support for Windows, i.e., like on
  Unix/Linux also on Windows we can now build in a separate build
  directory as alternative to ...\<package>\NT, and thus keep the latter
  clean from files generated during the build.  On Windows, the build
  directory must be a sibling of ...\<package>\NT .
